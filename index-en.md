### Hi

# ( ＾◡＾)っ ♡

It's my personal site. Here I post educational articles about [Python](/python-en), [C](/c-en) and using the [terminal](/terminal-en).

If you want to suggest some topic or just ask something -- find my contacts in [about](/about-en) section and send me a message. I'll be happy to talk with you!

You can navigate between sections of this site using computer in head of the page.

### Have fun!
